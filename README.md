Hello, I am @matschibatschi68
- 👀 I'm interested in traveling to the sea, learning languages, cooking, watching movies, my dog Joe, painting with oil&acrylic, music and much more ...
- 🌱 I am learning my Smarty, Less knowledge to expand. I'm also learning Symfony starting this summer to expand my Shopware 6 development.
- 💞️ I'm interested in working with people who have as much fun bringing Shopware projects to the finish line. 
- 📫 How to reach me: only by message in a bottle, because when it reaches me, I have only free resources again :-)<br/>
